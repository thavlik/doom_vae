# EARLY WORK IN PROGRESS

Variational autoencoders (VAE) trained on DOOM 1/2 gameplay videos

## Motivation
Latent representations and unsupervised pretraining boost data efficiency on more challenging supervised and reinforcement learning tasks. The goal of this project is to provide both the Doom and machine learning communities with:
- High quality datasets comprised of Doom gameplay
- Various ready-to-run VAE experiments
- Suitable boilerplate for derivative projects

### Relevant Literature

- [Progressive Growing of GANs for Improved Quality, Stability, and Variation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10196)

## TODO
- Progressive growing decoder (a la Karras 2018)
- Implement FID loss
- Dataset compiler
- ~~Doom gameplay video links~~
- ~~Implement entrypoints~~
- ~~Implement datasets~~
- ~~Resnet boilerplate~~
