# EARLY WORK IN PROGRESS

Variational autoencoders (VAE) trained on DOOM 1/2 gameplay videos

## Motivation
Latent representations and unsupervised pretraining boost data efficiency on more challenging supervised and reinforcement learning tasks. The goal of this project is to provide both the Doom and machine learning communities with:
- High quality datasets comprised of Doom gameplay
- Various ready-to-run VAE experiments
- Suitable foundation code for future research

## TODO
- Create a huge list of Doom gameplay videos on youtube in dataset/links.txt
- Implement entrypoints
- Implement datasets
- Appropriate quality resnet boilerplate
